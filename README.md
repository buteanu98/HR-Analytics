# HR-Analytics

In this Power BI case study, I explored a dataset for a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. I focused on importing, analyzing and visualizing Human Resources data in Power BI. B

I carried out exploratory data analysis and used DAX to build powerful visualizations. I finished the analysis by diving deeper into attrition and what factors impact attrition. This analysis will help the organization determine what action they will need to take to retain more employees.
